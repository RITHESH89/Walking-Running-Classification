# Walking vs Running Classification using Machine 

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying **human activities** — **Walking** and **Running** — using **machine learning techniques**.  
The model learns patterns from sensor or image data and predicts whether a person is walking or running.

This type of classification is widely used in:
- Fitness tracking apps
- Smartwatches & wearable devices
- Health monitoring systems
- Activity recognition systems


##  Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies **Walking** and **Running** activities based on given input features.

---

##  Dataset
- The dataset contains labeled samples of **walking** and **running** activities.
- Features may include:
  - Accelerometer values (X, Y, Z)
  - Speed or motion-related parameters
  - Image data (if using image-based classification)


##  Technologies Used
- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning is used)
- Jupyter Notebook


##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Prediction


##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- CNN (if image-based classification)


##  Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Sample Output
| Actual Activity | Predicted Activity |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Walking         | Walking           |
| Running         | Running           |



##  Results
- The trained model successfully classifies **Walking** and **Running** activities.
- Achieved **high accuracy** on test data.
- Can be extended for real-time activity recognition.
